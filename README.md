This codebase was adapted from https://github.com/Jiaoyang-Li/MAPF-LNS2 for research purposes. Please visit their repository for additional information on how to run the code. If you plan to use this codebase for your own research, please cite their work as well. Thank you.  

Delay Robust MAPF is a new methodology for rapid-replanning of MAPF plans that have experienced an unexpected delay during execution. The main contributions are the construction of a ``constrained graph`` that lives inside the ``DelayInstance" class.
